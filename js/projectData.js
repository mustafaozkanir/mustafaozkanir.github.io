            <p>
                This project focuses on generating <strong>QA (Question-Answer)</strong> and <strong>QAE (Question-Answer-Evaluation Criteria)</strong> pairs to fine-tune and benchmark large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific knowledge about TÃ¼rkiye. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that converts PDFs into high-quality QA/QAE pairs.
            </p>
            <h4>Pipeline Overview:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PDF Processing:</strong> Split PDFs into 10-page documents and summarize each.</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic Chunking:</strong> Break down documents into semantically meaningful chunks.</li>
                <li><strong>QA/QAE Generation:</strong> For each chunk, combine it with the summary of its document to generate QA(E) pairs.</li>
                <li><strong>LLM Integration:</strong> Used a chain-based LangChain structure for LLM prompting and output parsing.</li>
                <li><strong>Scale:</strong> Generated ~6,000 QA pairs and ~4,000 QAE pairs using an 8-bit quantized <strong>LLaMA 3.3 70B</strong> model.</li>
                <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Built a frontend with <strong>Gradio</strong> to adjust pipeline parameters and a <strong>Flask</strong> backend for seamless interaction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This pipeline generates the data required for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs, helping to keep their knowledge up-to-date with current events and developments in Turkey.
